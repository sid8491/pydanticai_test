# PydanticAI Test Repository
This repository is created to explore and experiment with PydanticAI, a Python agent framework designed to streamline the development of production-grade applications with Generative AI.

## About PydanticAI
PydanticAI aims to bring the "FastAPI feeling" to Generative AI app development. Just as FastAPI revolutionized web development with its ergonomic design built on Pydantic, PydanticAI simplifies the process of building AI-powered applications by leveraging Pydantic's robust validation and type-safety features.

Key Features of PydanticAI
* Built by Experts: Developed by the team behind Pydantic, used in popular frameworks like OpenAI SDK, LangChain, LlamaIndex, and more.
* Model-Agnostic: Supports multiple models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, Mistral) with an easy interface to add new ones.
* Type-Safe: Leverages Python type hints for structured and reliable development.
* Vanilla Python for Control Flow: No custom DSLs; use Python's development best practices for agent composition and control flow.
* Structured Response Validation: Validate responses (including streamed responses) using Pydantic.
* Dependency Injection: A novel, type-safe system for easier testing and iterative development.
* Logfire Integration: Tools for debugging and monitoring your application's performance and behavior.
